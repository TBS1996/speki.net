I'll add this to various linux package managers soon! But for now, if you wanna use it you can do the following:  
 
- make sure rust and git is installed
- in your terminal, navigate to where you wanna download this project 
- enter following command: 
```
 git clone https://github.com/TBS1996/speki
 ```
- in the  directory, enter "cargo run"

If you have any questions, feel free to open up an issue!
